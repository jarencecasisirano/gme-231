This is a repository for my LiDAR Remote Sensing coursework for my MS Geomatics Engineering program. This repository contains exercises and laboratory activities for LiDAR processing and analysis.

While the scripts are made available, other materials such as lectures and laboratory manuals were excluded to respect the intellectual property rights of the university and its faculty. Likewise, datasets were included if they were sourced publicly. Otherwise, the datasets are excluded on purpose.

## Laboratory Exercises

### [Laboratory Exercises 1 - Getting Started with LiDAR Processing Using R](./lab1/)

This exercise introduces how to load and view LiDAR data in R. It covers essential steps such as data preprocessing, generating digital elevation models (DEMs), canopy height models (CHMs), and identifying trees in aerial LiDAR scenes. Download the [sample LiDAR dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJESNb1omVxZe7QfLVuFwbv3h1Ejynek/edit) (or use this [reduced LiDAR dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10haTLnfDxi7ge0yTKNDDCTEPn-Hd-9Mr/view) instead).

This exercise was derived from [this tutorial](https://lab.jonesctr.org/lidar-processing-for-forestry-and-natural-resources-module-1-viewing-data/) by Jeffery B. Cannon, a landscape ecologist from The Jones Center at Ichauway.
